# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).

# Important: you do not need to round the result to the nearest whole number. It's fine to print out a floating point number for this exercise. The interpretation message needs to include the words from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# HEIGHT IN METERS !!!  .e.g. 1.55
height = float(input("Your height? "))
#  weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = float(input("Your weight? "))

bmi = weight / (height * height)

if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
