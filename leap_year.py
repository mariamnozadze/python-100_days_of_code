# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
# on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

year = int(input("write a year: "))

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap Year")
    else:
      print("Not leap year")
  else:
    print("Leap year")
